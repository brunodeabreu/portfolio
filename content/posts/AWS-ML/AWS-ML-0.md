## Machine Learning Concepts

*Industry Applications*

-   Recommendation Engines
-   Demand Forecasting
-   Computer Vision
-   Fraud Detection
-   Medical Diagnosis
-   Stock Marketing Forecasting
-   Sentiment Analysis

*Basic Terminology*

-   **Features** : *each item or piece of data that described by a number of features*

-   **Labels** : *each item or piece of data may be tagged with known classification result*

-   **Instances** : *an instance or sample is an item within the dataset, each instance will have a set of features, and may also have label assigned to it*

*Machine Learning Types*

-   **Supervised** : *some sort of **algorithm** to analyze and learn from past observations, enabling you to then **predict** future events, the goal is **infer**, an approximate **mapping function** that can be applied to one or more input variables, and **produce an output** variable or **result***

    - Classification problem : Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes, KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forest

    - Regression problem : Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest

-   **Unsupervised**: Designed to work with unlabeled data set, looking for patterns in structure. Used to solve problems related to Cluster, Anomaly Detection, Association Discovery

    - Algorithms: K Means, Hierarchical, Gaussian Mixture  for cluster analysis
